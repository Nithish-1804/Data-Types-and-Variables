## C++ and Data Structures 
# Data Types and Variables, basic Input Output operations

In C++ programming, datatypes and variables are foundational concepts that enable you to work with and manipulate data effectively. Datatypes define the type of data that a variable can hold, while variables are symbolic names for memory locations used to store values. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and structured code.

## Types of Datatypes
C++ offers a variety of datatypes to accommodate different types of data:

1. **Integers (int)**: Used for storing whole numbers, both positive and negative.
1. **Floating-Point Numbers (float, double)**: Used for storing decimal numbers. float represents single-precision floating-point numbers, while double represents double-precision floating-point numbers with higher precision.
1. **Characters (char)**: Used for storing individual characters, like letters, digits, or symbols.
1. **Boolean (bool)**: Used for storing true or false values, helpful for decision-making and conditional statements.
