## C++ and Data Structures 
# Data Types and Variables, basic Input Output operations

In C++ programming, datatypes and variables are foundational concepts that enable you to work with and manipulate data effectively. Datatypes define the type of data that a variable can hold, while variables are symbolic names for memory locations used to store values. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and structured code.

## Types of Datatypes
C++ offers a variety of datatypes to accommodate different types of data:

1. **Integers (int)**: Used for storing whole numbers, both positive and negative.
1. **Floating-Point Numbers (float, double)**: Used for storing decimal numbers. float represents single-precision floating-point numbers, while double represents double-precision floating-point numbers with higher precision.
1. **Characters (char)**: Used for storing individual characters, like letters, digits, or symbols.
1. **Boolean (bool)**: Used for storing true or false values, helpful for decision-making and conditional statements.

## Uses of Datatypes and Variables
1. **Memory Allocation**: Datatypes determine the amount of memory allocated for a variable. Using appropriate datatypes ensures efficient memory usage.
1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Different datatypes support various arithmetic operations. For example, you can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numeric datatypes.
1. **Data Manipulation**: Variables hold data that can be modified and processed as needed. This is essential for performing calculations and transformations on data.
1. **User Input and Output**: Variables are often used to store user inputs and provide meaningful output, making programs interactive and user-friendly.
1. **Decision-Making**: Boolean variables are crucial for implementing decision-making logic using conditional statements like if, else, and switch.
1. **Looping**: Variables are frequently used as loop counters to control the number of iterations in loops like for and while.
1. **Data Storage**: Variables store data temporarily during the execution of a program. This data can be used to perform various tasks and calculations.
